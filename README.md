# NYU Computer Vision Assignments

This repository contains assignments and implementations for the NYU Computer Vision course (CSCI-GA 2271).

## Overview

The assignments cover fundamental and advanced topics in computer vision and deep learning, including image processing, neural networks, transformers, generative models, and modern vision models.

### Assignments

- **Assignment 1**: 
  - Part 1: Image Filtering and Gradient Operators
  - Part 2: Automatic Differentiation
  - Part 3: Convolutional Neural Networks from Scratch

- **Assignment 2**:
  - Part 1: Object Detection
  - Part 2: Transformers for Sequence-to-Sequence Tasks

- **Assignment 3**: 
  - Part 1: Variational Autoencoders
  - Part 2: Diffusion Models

### Additional Notebooks

- `Playing_Around_With_SigLip_SAM_models.ipynb`: Experiments with SigLip for zero-shot classification, Stable Diffusion for image generation, and SAM for segmentation.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SiddarthNilol/NYU_Computer_Vision
   cd NYU_Computer_Vision
   ```

2. Install dependencies for specific assignments as needed.

## Usage

Each assignment is contained in its respective Jupyter notebook. Open the notebooks in Jupyter or Google Colab and run the cells in order.

- For assignments requiring datasets, follow the instructions in the notebooks (e.g., downloading data).
- Training scripts are provided in subfolders where applicable.
